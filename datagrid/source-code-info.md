# Source Code Information

The complete C# and XAML source code to the Xceed.Wpf.DataGrid.dll and Xceed.Wpf.Controls.dll assemblies, as well as all the files required in order to compile and build these .NET assemblies, is available through a Blueprint subscription. The source code is delivered in a separate installation kit from the main Xceed DataGrid for WPF package, and is provided only to registered users that have purchased a Blueprint subscription.

**The source code available through a Blueprint subscription contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of Xceed Software Inc. and its use is strictly subject to the terms and conditions of the [XCEED SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://xceed.com/xceed-software-license-agreement/) included with the source code.**

## Specifically what source code is included and what is not included
Everything you need to build the DLL assemblies mentioned above is included. 

Note: All source code comments and remarks from the original development source code have been preserved to increase its value for educational purposes.

## Usage instructions and recommendations  
To use the source code available through a Blueprint subscription, simply run the Xceed.Wpf.DataGrid.Blueprint.exe self-extracting zip file to unzip the source code files into the suggested folder or the folder of your choice and then load the Xceed.Wpf.DataGrid.sln file into Visual Studio.NET and build the solution. 

The resulting DLLs do not have a "strong name" embedded into them, and so it is not possible to register them in the .NET Global Assembly Cache. Please refer to the Microsoft .NET documentation on how to assign a strong name to an assembly. 

If you wish to distribute the assemblies you have built from the Blueprint subscription source code, it is strongly recommended that you rename the assemblies, for example by adding "Custom" in their name, in order to make them identifiable to both you and Xceed as corrected or modified versions. Remember that distribution of Blueprint subscription source code (whether compiled or in source code form) is strictly subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement.
