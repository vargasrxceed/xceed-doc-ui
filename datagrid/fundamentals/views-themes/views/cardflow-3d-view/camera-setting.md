# Cardflow 3D View Camera Settings

In addition to allowing the cards to be positioned in a 3-dimensional universe, the Cardflowâ„¢ 3D View also exposes various settings that allow its camera to be moved and positioned along the X, Y, and Z axes to provide any desired depth perception and view angle.

Camera Positioning
The CameraXOffset, CameraYOffset, and CameraZOffset properties determine the offset of the camera, in card widths, from the middle of the center card on their corresponding axis (see Figure 1).

***Figure 1:**  Camera movement along the X, Y, and Z axes*

When the camera moves along the X and Y axes, it can either continuously look at the corresponding X or Y origins or straight ahead according to the values of the `CameraLooksAtOriginOnX` and `CameraLooksAtOriginOnY` properties. For example, if the camera were to move in a negative direction (left) along the X axis and in a positive direction (up) along the Y axis with both the `CameraLooksAtOriginOnX` and `CameraLooksAtOriginOnY` properties set to **false**, it would look straight ahead without looking at the cards, which would then be visible only on the lower right (see Figure 2). With the camera in the same position but looking at both the X and Y origins, the result would be that the center card would always remain visible and in the center of the viewport (see Figure 3).

The `CameraRevolutionXAngle` and `CameraRevolutionYAngle` properties determine the angle of the camera as it revolves on the X or Y axis, respectively (see Figure 5).

:::note
The `CameraLooksAtCenterOnX` and `CameraLooksAtCenterOnY` properties do not influence the direction the camera looks when it revolves on the X or Y axis, nor will modifications made to the `CameraRevolutionXAngle` and `CameraRevolutionYAngle` properties affect the direction the camera looks.
:::

In addition to positioning the camera along any of the 3 axes and modifying its look direction, it is also possible to change the camera's field of view through the `FieldOfView` property. By default, the field of view is set to a 45 degree angle; however, it can be increased or decreased to change the angular extent of the cards.
