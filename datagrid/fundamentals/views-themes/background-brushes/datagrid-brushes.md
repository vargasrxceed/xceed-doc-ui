# DataGridControl Brushes

Whereas themes determine the color and look of the elements in a view, backgrounds can be applied to the rest of the datagrid control, in all views.

The brushes displayed below are exposed by the static DataGridControlBackgroundBrushes class and can be used by assigning them to a grid's Background property (see Example 1 in [Background Brushes Overview](overview)).
