# Card Brushes

Whereas themes determine the color and look of the elements in a view and backgrounds are applied to the rest of the datagrid control, card brushes are applied to cards in both 2D and 3D card-view layouts to give them a textured look and feel.

The brushes displayed below are exposed by the static CardBackgroundBrushes class and can be applied by creating a style that targets DataRow (or any other Row type) and that sets its Background property to the desired brush must be provided (see Example 2 in [Background Brushes Overview](overview)).

## Textures
These striking textures can be added to cards and are applied to their backgrounds, giving them a unique look and feel.
