# Migrating from Version 3.5
Although every attempt was made to prevent breaking interface changes between versions 3.5 and 3.6, some were inevitable. This topic describes the most notable breaking changes, as well as behavior changes and obsolete members.

## Breaking Changes
The clipboard exporter now exports the column Title instead of the column FieldName. To revert to the old behavior, set the exporter's UseFieldNamesInHeader property to **true**.
## Behavior Changes
Dragging the FixedColumnSplitter is now animated under TableflowView when IsAnimatedColumnReorderingEnabled is enabled.
## Obsolete Members
The DataGridItemsHost ParentDataGridControl property is now obsolete. Please use DataGridContext.DataGridControl instead.
