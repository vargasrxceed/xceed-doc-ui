# Migrating from Version 6.1

Although every attempt was made to prevent breaking interface changes between versions 6.1 and 6.2, some were inevitable. This topic describes the most notable behavior changes and obsolete members.

## Behavior Changes
A default ForeignKeyConveter is set on ForeignKeyConverter, just as it is done for a ForeignKeyDescription, so that setting a ValuePath along a DisplayMemberPath will now work without the need to add a converter.
## Obsolete Members
The UseDefaultHeadersFooters property on GroupConfiguration is now obsolete. Please use the new DefaultHeadersFootersType property instead.
