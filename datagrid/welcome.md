# Welcome to Xceed DataGrid for WPF

Welcome to the documentation for **Xceed DataGrid for WPF**, the most mature grid of its kind and the first and only to provide a rich, fluid, and high performance user experience.

The most popular experience **Xceed DataGrid for WPF** provides is its *Tableflow™* view, which lets you take advantage of a stunning, shaded appearance and capabilities such as inertial smooth scrolling and animated full-column reordering—which mimic the physics of real-life movement. Add to that the datagrid’s zero-lag data virtualization, and you have the fastest WPF datagrid around—in performance and feel. There's also classic table view, tree gridflow view, card view, and 3D views.

It's rock-solid and time-tested, so you can trust it in your most important applications. Constantly evolving—no other datagrid is updated nearly as often—it has more features than any other offering and a flexible, extensible object model. It also provides unbeatable performance by handling millions of rows and thousands of columns, and integrates easily into any WPF app. It’s easy to understand why it’s the most-adopted WPF datagrid available and used by Microsoft, IBM, and in major financial industry trading platforms.

Featuring rich in-place editing that delivers 12 flexible, themed, and themable editor controls that are also usable outside the grid (including a datepicker and a masked textbox, two important editor controls that Windows Presentation Foundation lacks) and powerful hierarchical grouping and master-detail, **Xceed DataGrid for WPF** provides an interactive Cardflow™ 3D view with multiple card layouts, as well as traditional table and card views. End-users can switch between any 2D and 3D view on the fly while retaining the datagrid’s state.

Developed entirely for WPF, and built for .NET 4.5 & up, **Xceed DataGrid for WPF** also features high-quality, pixel-perfect themes such as Metro, Windows 7, Windows 8, Glass, Office 2007, Media, Material Design and Fluent Design as well as Classic, Luna, Aero, Royale, and Zune. The datagrid’s rich printing support allows for easy report creation, while its statistical rows and functions can be used both inside and outside of a grid in any element. Column stretching and column widths supporting star values are also supported. Excel export is supported (XMLSS and CSV), and user settings can be persisted and restored. Automatic Excel-like filtering lets end-users better manage the data they see, as do the fixed-column and the custom sorting functionalities. Finally, UI, data, and column virtualization reduces load time and memory usage. 

**Xceed DataGrid for WPF** is available through a subscription that delivers much more than just a perpetual license for versions received during the subscription. You also get a year of great services: expert priority support and access to new controls, new versions, new features, and bug fixes. Additional years can be added at a discounted price at the time of purchase or before the subscription expires; a new subscription is required after it has expired. Choosing the Blueprint subscription adds the full C# and XAML source.
