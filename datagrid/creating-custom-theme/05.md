# Part 5: Using Your Custom Theme

After all that styling and templating, you're probably anxious to use your new theme. This is the part you were waiting for.

Once compiled, the project you created in Part 1 creates an assembly, which will be imported into the application where you want to use it. Your theme's name, namespace, and assembly name are defined in the project settings. You will need this information before we continue. Go ahead, I'll wait... 

:::note
By default, the project's name is used as both the assembly name and namespace. If you provide a name other than **Office2007Tutorial** some parts of this tutorial may not work; notably, when trying to use your custom-theme assembly. In this case, you will need to make the necessary modifications to the examples below to either use your assembly name and namespace, or change them in the project's properties.

OK, with your clipboard armed with your theme's information, follow the steps detailed below to use your theme. For those of you who are saying,

  <summary>Ugh... show me the code already!</summary>

  This first portion of code demonstrates how to retrieve data from the Orders table of the Northwind database. It also assumes that the Northwind database, which is installed (on Vista) in the "C:\ProgramData\Xceed Software", is included in the project within a Data folder. If you are not on Vista, searching for "Northwind.mdb" will locate the file.

  This code should be placed in your App.xaml.cs or App.xaml.vb code-behind file.

1. Open the project that contains the grid to which you want to apply your theme, and add the custom theme's assembly. Refer to the Creating your first DataGrid Project topic if you require help.
2. Add your theme's namespace mapping using the xmlns attribute. You can add it either to the window's characteristics or in any other location, as long as the grid that will be themed is in the same scope.
3. Because your theme is not part of the default themes provided by Xceed, you need to use property element syntax to set the Theme property.
4. There is no 4, you're done! Hit F5 and enjoy!
