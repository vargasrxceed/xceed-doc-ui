# Part 3: Styling

Styling is the "easier" part of creating a custom theme, so I will start with this to get you in the mood. Do you remember the naming convention described earlier? We will be searching for elements using this convention, so if you don't remember, take a moment to refresh your memory and reread the naming convention section in part 1.

The list of elements to style was provided in the previous part, but for simplicity's sake, it has been copied over to this part as well (see Table 1). Each modified style will be included for those of you who prefer to just copy-and-paste code.

**Table 1**: Elements to style

|Element to style	|What we will be changing|
|-----------------|------------------------|
|DataGridControl|	Background, Foreground, and FontFamily|
|RowSelectorPane|	Background and Foreground|
|Row	|SelectionBackground and SelectionForeground|
|ColumnManagerRow|	Background, BorderBrush, and BorderThickness|
|ColumnManagerCell|	Padding|
|HierarchicalGroupByControl	|Background and Foreground|
|GroupByItem	|Background, BorderBrush, and BorderThickness|
|GroupHeaderControl|	Background, BorderThickness, and BorderBrush|
|TableView|HorizontalGridLineBrush and VerticalGridLineThickness|
|groupByConnectionLinePen resource ( GroupByControl.ConnectionLinePen)	|Providing a new Pen|
|dropMarkPen resource ( ViewBase.DropMarkPen)	|Providing a new Pen| 

## Styling Elements
1. The first element to style—although order has no importance what-so-ever—is the **DataGridControl**, so in your custom-theme project:
search for "**STYLE: DataGridControl**". This style will change the background to white, the foreground to black, and the font family to Calibri (only available when Office 2007 is installed).

    <details>

        <summary>View the modified properties of the DataGridControl style</summary>

            ```xml
            <Setter Property="Background"
                    Value="White"/>
            <Setter Property="Foreground"
                    Value="Black" />
            <Setter Property="TextElement.FontFamily" 
                    Value="Calibri"/>
            ```
    </details>     

2. Next, we will be providing a new style for the RowSelectorPane, so search for "STYLE: RowSelectorPane". This style will change the background so that is uses the rowSelectorBrush static resource and sets the foreground to #9AC6FF (some sort of blue... I'm not a graphical designer).

    The linear gradient brush represented by the rowSelectorBrush resource must be added to the "Resources specific to this view/theme/colorscheme" section of the TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml file.

    <details>

        <summary>  View the modified properties of the RowSelectorPane style</summary>

            ```xml
            <Setter Property="Background"
                Value="{StaticResource rowSelectorBrush}"/>
            <Setter Property="TextElement.Foreground"
                    Value="#9AC6FF"/>
            ```
    </details>  


    <details>

        <summary> View the declaration of the rowSelectorBrush resource</summary>

         ```xml
          <LinearGradientBrush x:Key="rowSelectorBrush"
                            StartPoint="0,0.5"
                            EndPoint="1,0.5">
              <GradientStop Color="#FFFFFF"
                            Offset="0"/>
              <GradientStop Color="#C4DDFF"
                            Offset="1"/>   
          </LinearGradientBrush>
          ```
    </details>
   
   
3. The third style will change the selection background and foreground of the standard **Row** element to #A7CDF0 and black respectively, so search for "**STYLE: Row**" to change the colors (you will get more than one hit if you don't have the "match whole word" search option enabled).    


    <details>

        <summary>View the modified properties of the Row style</summary>

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="SelectionBackground"
                  Value="#A7CDF0"/>
          <Setter Property="SelectionForeground"
                  Value="Black"/>
          ```
    </details>

4. Next up is the style for the **ColumnManagerRow** element in which we will change the background so that it uses the **columnManagerBrush** static resource, sets the border brush to #6593CF, and the border thickness to display a 1-pixel border on the top and bottom. As you probably have guessed, search for "**STYLE: ColumnManagerRow**" to find the style and change the values.

    The linear gradient brush represented by the **columnManagerBrush** resource must be added to the "**Resources specific to this view/theme/colorscheme**" section of the **TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml** file.

    <details>

        <summary>View the modified properties of the ColumnManagerRow style</summary>

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="Background"
                  Value="{StaticResource columnManagerBrush}" />
              
          <Setter Property="BorderBrush"
                  Value="#6593CF"/>

          <Setter Property="BorderThickness"
                  Value="0,1,0,1"/>
          ```
    </details>

    <details>

        <summary>View the declaration of the columnManagerBrush resource</summary>

         ```xml
          <LinearGradientBrush x:Key="columnManagerBrush"
                                StartPoint="0.5,0"           
                                EndPoint="0.5,1">
              <GradientStop Color="#FFFFFF"
                            Offset="0" />         
              <GradientStop Color="#C4DDFF"
                            Offset="1" /> 
            </LinearGradientBrush>
          ```
    </details>

5. At this point, you probably get how this works, so I will just put the modified styles for the remaining elements. You can refer to Table 1 for the list of properties that will be modified as well as read the comments in the XAML code for more information.

    <details>

        <summary>ColumnManagerCell style modifications</summary>

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="Padding" Value="4,5,0,0" />
          ```
    </details>

    <details>

        <summary>HierarchicalGroupByControl style modifications</summary>

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="Background"
                Value="{StaticResource groupByControlBackgroundBrush}" />

          <Setter Property="Foreground"
                  Value="#15428B"/>
          ```
          The linear gradient brush represented by the **groupByControlBackgroundBrush** resource must be added to the "**Resources specific to this view/theme/colorscheme**" section of the **TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml** file.

          ```xml
          <LinearGradientBrush x:Key="groupByControlBackgroundBrush" StartPoint="0.5,0" EndPoint="0.5,1">
            <GradientStop Color="#E3EFFF" Offset="0" />
            <GradientStop Color="#AFD2FF" Offset="1" />
          </LinearGradientBrush>
          ```
    </details>

    <details>

        <summary>HierachicalGroupByItem style</summary>

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="Background"
                  Value="{StaticResource columnManagerCellBrush}" />

          <Setter Property="BorderBrush"
                  Value="{StaticResource borderBrush}" />

          <Setter Property="BorderThickness"
                  Value="1" /> 
          ```
    </details>

    <details>

        <summary>TableView style</summary>

        Contrary to the other styles, the **TableView** style can be located by searching for "**Default values for the View**".

         ```xml
          <Setter Property="VerticalGridLineThickness"
                        Value="0" />
          <Setter Property="HorizontalGridLineBrush"
                  Value="#E3EFFF" />
          ```
    </details>

6. The style for the **dropMarkPen** resource is modified in the same way as other element styles; however, it is not found in the same manner. Resources are used in multiple styles by various elements. Therefore, they are declared in a resource dictionary, which all elements can access (I will let the Microsoft SDK explain that one). To find the **dropMarkPen** resource, search for "**x:Key="dropMarkPen**"".

    If you did not notice, all the styles except **dropMarkPen** were located in **TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml**. The dropMarkPen resource is different because it is located in the **Office2007Tutorial.Resources.xaml** file, which contains resources that are available to all the views (if we were supporting more than TableView). This file is included into the resource dictionary in the **TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml** file. OK, enough reading, here are the modified styles:

      <details>

        <summary>dropMarkPen style</summary>

         ```xml
          <Pen x:Key="dropMarkPen" Brush="#A7CDF0" Thickness="7" />  
          ```
    </details>

    The last step is to add a new **Pen** named "groupByConnectionLinePen" to the theme and assign it to the **ConnectionLinPen** property of the **GroupByControl** through a setter in the style.

      <details>

        <summary>groupByConnectionLinePen style</summary>

         ```xml
          <Pen x:Key="groupByConnectionLinePen" Thickness="1" Pen.Brush="#6F9DD9"/>

          <Setter Property="ConnectionLinePen" Value={StaticResource groupByConnectionLinePen}/>
          ```
    </details>

That's it for the styles! Now go get a coffee—or any other drink of choice—because next come the templates.
