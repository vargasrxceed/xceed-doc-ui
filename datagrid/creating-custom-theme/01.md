# Part 1: Creating a Theme Project

When you installed Xceed DataGrid for WPF, a project template for creating custom themes was added to Visual Studio's list of available projects types. So let's get started and create our custom-theme project.

1. Open Visual Studio and select the **File\New\Project** menu to display the **New Project** window. 
2. Under **Visual C#** or **Other Languages\Visual Basic**, select the **Xceed** folder.
3. In the **Templates** pane, select the **WPF DataGrid Theme** template. 
4. Enter the name, location, and solution name you want. For the purposes of this tutorial, I will be using **Office2007Tutorial**.

    :::note
    By default, the project's name is used as both the assembly name and namespace. If you provide a name other than **Office2007Tutorial** some parts of this tutorial may not work; notably, when trying to use your custom-theme assembly in part 5. In this case, you will need to make the necessary modifications to the examples demonstrated in part 5 to either use your assembly name and namespace, or change them in the project's properties.

5. Press **OK**. The **Create WPF DataGrid Theme** dialog in which the views to support can be selected will be displayed. This custom theme will only support **Table View** so remove the **Card View** and **Compact-card View** target views.

6. Press **OK**.

Once the project is open, you will notice a couple of files that have been automatically included. These files contain the styles and other various resources required by the theme. The following table provides a list of these files as well as their purpose:

|File	|What is it used for?|
|-----|--------------------|
|Office2007Tutorial.Resources.xaml|	Contains default values and resources that can be used by any view. |
|TableView.Office2007Tutorial.Graphics.xaml	|Contains various view-specific graphics that are used by the theme.|
|TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml	|Main entry point of your theme. All styles that are applied to the elements in a grid are defined in this file.|
generic.xaml	|Contains various resources specific to the theme. There is no need to touch this file.|
|Office2007TutorialTheme.cs	|Class which defines the theme class, its name, as well as the views it supports.|

The default element templates are view dependent and are located in each view-appropriate grid-element template XAML file (e.g.,** TableView.GridElementTemplates.xaml**). These files can be found in the common-theme folder located under the Xceed DataGrid for WPF installation folder in the Themes\Common folder. The default templates for the elements that will be re-templated will be retrieved from these files. 

## Naming Conventions
Each element has a style which is defined in **TableView.Office2007Tutorial.xaml**. These styles are identified by the name of each element's associated class preceded by the word "STYLE:". To locate a specific style, simply search for "STYLE: " followed by the class name (e.g., "STYLE: GroupByItem").

Templates, like styles are identified by the name of each element's associated class but preceded by the word "TEMPLATE: ". To locate a specific template, simply search for "TEMPLATE: " followed by the class name  (e.g., "TEMPLATE: DataGridControl").

For those of you who dread searching for styles and templates, they will be included in this tutorial so they can be pasted directly into your custom theme.

## Using Your Custom Theme
Most people like to see the result of their work as they are creating it. If this is your case, you can jump to [part 5](05) which will take you through the necessary steps needed to use your custom-theme assembly in a working project. At any time, just recompile the theme assembly to see the results as you work.

## Visual Studio Designer
Xceed DataGrid for WPF is not supported in the design-time surface of Visual Studio 2005; therefore, it is suggested that you always open datagrid-related XAML files with the XML editor. To make this your default setting when opening an XAML file:

1. right-click on an XAML file in the project and select the **Open With**... menu option;
2. select the XML Editor in the **Open With** dialog;
3. click the "Set as default" button;
4. and press **OK**.

This will prevent the designer from being used by default when an XAML file is opened.
