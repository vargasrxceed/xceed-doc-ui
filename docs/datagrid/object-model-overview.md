If you are new to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), it is necessary to understand a few basic concepts before using Xceed DataGrid for WPF, notably, the **ItemsControl**, **ContentControl**, and **ContentPresenter** classes.

The **ItemsControl** class (e.g., **DataGridControl**) represents a control that is used to display a collection of items. The **ItemsPanel**, which is a template that can be replaced or modified to rearrange the disposition of the items within the **ItemsControl**, defines the layout of the items contained in an **ItemsControl**.

The **ContentControl** class (e.g., Cell) represents a control which contains a single piece of content that is accessible through the **Content** property. The **ContentPresenter** determines how and where the content of the **ContentControl** is displayed in the visual tree.

## Anatomy of the DataGridControl Class
At the root of Xceed's WPF datagrid is the `DataGridControl` class, which derives from **ItemsControl** and is used to display a collection of data items. A `DataRow` is the UI representation of a data item and will contain a DataCell for each property in the data item. **DataRow** and **DataCell** objects have a limited lifespan and will only exist while the data item is visible in a grid's viewport (virtualization).

DataCells, which display the value of the corresponding property in the data item, are **ContentControls**. How and where the cell's content is displayed is determined by the **ContentPresenter** that is defined by the cell's **ControlTemplate**.

## A Closer Look at the Major Components
The grid's major components include `rows`, `cells`, `columns`, and their derivatives. `DataRow` objects provide the UI representation of the data items displayed in a grid's viewport and contain a cell for each property in the data item. As previously mentioned, **DataRow** and **DataCell** objects  have a limited lifespan and exist only while they are visible in a grid's viewport; this is called virtualization and is the reason that the **Items**, `SelectedItem`, `SelectedItems`, and `CurrentItem` properties of the **DataGridControl** class access data items and not data rows.

The appearance of the data items is determined by the style or template that is applied to the resulting **DataRow** objects. **DataRow** styles can be provided implicitly or they can be assigned to the **ItemContainerStyle** property of the **DataGridControl** or `GroupConfiguration` classes. **DataRow** templates can be provided by creating an implicit ControlTemplate or by assigning the template to the ItemTemplate property defined on the **DataGridControl** class (see `Templates` and `Styles`).

Each **DataRow** that is created will contain a cell for each property in the data item. Each cell is a separate **ContentControl** in which the value of the corresponding property in the data item is displayed. The cells contained in a **DataRow** can be accessed through the row's Cells collection.

Like **DataRows**, the appearance and behavior of cells can be modified by creating a style for the **DataCell** class, or by providing a new **ControlTemplate** or **Style** for a specific **Cell** type (see Templates and `Styles`). Remember that a style must target a specific type, for example, `DataCell`.

`Columns` define information on how the cells they contain are displayed and their content edited. In addition to the properties provided by each cell, a column's `CellContentTemplate` property can be used to provide a new template that will be used by all the cells it contains to display their data. The list of all columns contained in a grid can be accessed through the Columns collection of the **DataGridControl** class.

Each column has a title which is is displayed in its corresponding cell in any `ColumnManagerRow` objects found in a grid. By default, this title corresponds to the `FieldName` property; however, any value can be provided by setting the Title property.

Merged column headers allow you to organize columns vertically under headers that span multiple columns; for example, company name, company address, and company ID columns could be placed together under a "Company" title, helping to better present the data in the datagrid.

See the DataGrid sample in the LiveExplorer application for examples.
