# Masked Editors

The MaskedTextBox, which derives from the `ValueRangeTextBox`, forces inputted text to match the mask defined by its Mask and `MaskedTextProvider` properties (see Table 1 for a list of the supported mask characters). In addition to the limitations imposed by the mask, the inputted characters can be limited on only **ASCII** characters according to the value of the `RestrictToAscii` property.

Table 1: Supported mask characters
