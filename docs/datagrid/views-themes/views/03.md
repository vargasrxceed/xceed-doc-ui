# View Properties

The `ViewProperty` attribute, which is set on various view properties, determines how or if the view property on which it is set can be accessed through a **ViewBinding**. If set to None or if the attribute is not set at all, the property cannot be accessed through a **ViewBinding**. If set to ViewOnly, the property will be accessible through a **ViewBinding**. Setting the `ViewProperty` attribute to Routed or `RoutedNoFallback`, allows an attached property to be accessed through a **ViewBinding**.
