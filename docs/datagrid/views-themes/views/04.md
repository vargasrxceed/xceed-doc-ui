# Tableflow View: Smooth Scrolling and Other Animated Effects

The Tableflow™ view is represented by the `TableflowView` class. It differs greatly from the `TableView` class from which it derives. It provides a rich, fluid, and high performance user experience, featuring a capabilities such as inertial smooth scrolling and animated full-column reordering, which mimic the physics of real-life movement.

## Smooth Scrolling
The rows in the Tableflow™ view flow smoothly into the viewport, rather than simply popping into existence. This lets the end-user more easily see the data as it moves into view. Furthermore, smooth scrolling is supported when the data source is virtualized, which further improves the user experience.
