# Animation Settings

The various animations that occur while scrolling, loading, and manipulating elements in a listbox can be configured through its `AnimationSettings` property.

Most animations can be configured through a pair of properties (see Table 1) that determine their duration and easing function. The default duration and easing function can be set through the `DefaultDuration` and `DefaultEasingFunction` properties, respectively. These values will be used when a duration or easing-function property does not have an explicit value.

:::tip
The values assigned to the `DefaultDuration` and `DefaultEasingFunction` properties will only be taken into consideration if a new `ListBoxAnimationSettings` instance is provided.

The following XAML snippets show how to disable and modify the behavior of various animations.

```xml
<!-- Disable all animations -->
<Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot">
   <Grid.Resources>
       <xclb:ListBoxAnimationSettings x:Key="disableAllAnimationSettings"
                                       DefaultDuration="00:00:00.0"
                                       DefaultEasingFunction="{x:Null}"/>
   </Grid.Resources>
   <xclb:ListBox x:Name="listBox"
                         ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Orders}"
                         AnimationSettings="{StaticResource disableAllAnimationSettings}"/>
</Grid>
```

```xml
<!-- Slow down all the animations -->
<Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot">
   <Grid.Resources>
      <xclb:ListBoxAnimationSettings x:Key="slowMotionAnimationSettings"
                                      AddingItemDuration="00:00:01.500"
                                      ItemSizeChangingDuration="00:00:01.500"
                                      LineScrollingDuration="00:00:01.500"
                                      LoadingDuration="00:00:01.500"                                     
                                      PageScrollingDuration="00:00:01.500"                                     
                                      RemovingItemDuration="00:00:01.500"                                     
                                      ThumbScrollingDuration="00:00:01.500"                                     
                                      ViewChangingDuration="00:00:01.500"/>
   </Grid.Resources>
   <xclb:ListBox x:Name="listBox"
                         ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Orders}"
                         AnimationSettings="{StaticResource slowMotionAnimationSettings}"/>
</Grid>
