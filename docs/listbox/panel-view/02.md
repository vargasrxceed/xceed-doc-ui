# The PathPanel, PathView, and PathConfiguration Classes

The `PathPanel` and `PathView` classes display listbox items along a "path," allowing for the creation of unique, eye-catching applications. The settings available for configuring a path make it easy to draw attention to the most important item in the list in a striking fashion (see Configuring the Path below).

The PathView is used in the `MultiViewPanel` class to provide easy, animated switching between views. It is otherwise identical to `PathPanel` in terms of functionality.

The following XAML illustrates how to set up a simple `PathPanel`.

```xml
<xclb:ListBox Name="listBox1"
     ToolPaneVisibility="Collapsed">
  ...
  <xclb:ListBox.ItemsPanel>
    <xclb:ItemsPanelTemplate>
      <xclb:PathPanel>
        <xclb:PathPanel.PathConfiguration>
          <xclb:PathConfiguration PathPadding="40"
                                  PathStretch="Fill">
            <xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
              <PathGeometry>
                <PathFigure IsClosed="False"
                  IsFilled="False"
                  StartPoint="100,0">
                  <BezierSegment Point1="-75,50"
                      Point2="175,150"
                      Point3="0,200" />
                </PathFigure>
              </PathGeometry>
            </xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
          </xclb:PathConfiguration>
        </xclb:PathPanel.PathConfiguration>
      </xclb:PathPanel>
    </xclb:ItemsPanelTemplate>
  </xclb:ListBox.ItemsPanel>
  ...
</xclb:ListBox>
```

## Configuring the Path
The path in a `PathPanel` or a `PathView` is determined through their `PathConfiguration` properties. The `PathConfiguration` class provides several properties to configure the path.

The `PathGeometry` property defines the shape of the path and takes a Geometry-derived object. The following XAML shows how to set the path to an S-shape.

```xml
<xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
  <PathGeometry>
    <PathFigure IsClosed="False"
      IsFilled="False"
      StartPoint="100,0">
      <BezierSegment Point1="-75,50"
          Point2="175,150"
          Point3="0,200" />
    </PathFigure>
  </PathGeometry>
</xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
```

When the `ContainerOrientation` property is set to None, items are oriented so that they are always parallel to the horizontal edges of the application, window, or screen. When set to `OrientOnPath`, items will be rotated to be perpendicular to the axis of the path segment they are on. The `ContainerPadding` property specifies a device-independent units (1/96th inch per unit) measure representing the padding between items.

The ScalingStops and `ZIndexStops` properties contain collections of `ScalingStop` and `ZIndexStop` objects, respectively, which influence the scaling and z-order of items depending on their current position on the path. The `ScalingStop` instances in the collection determine the ScalingFactor at a given Offset on the path. The `ZIndexStop` instances in the collection determine the `ZIndexFactor` (depth) at a given Offset on the path. Together, they allow items to be displayed as if they are receding in the distance along the path. As a result, the end-user's attention can be directed to the current or most important item, for example.

The following XAML shows how to configure a path that will create an "oval" effect of the items.

```xml
<xclb:PathPanel.PathConfiguration>
  <xclb:PathConfiguration PathPadding="100"
                          ContainerPadding="-150">
    <xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
      <EllipseGeometry Center="100,100"
                       RadiusX="100"
                       RadiusY="100" />
    </xclb:PathConfiguration.PathGeometry>
    <xclb:PathConfiguration.ScalingStops>
      <xclb:ScalingStop Offset="0"
                        ScalingFactor="0.15" />
      <xclb:ScalingStop Offset="0.5"
                        ScalingFactor="1.1" />
      <xclb:ScalingStop Offset="1"
                        ScalingFactor="0.15" />
    </xclb:PathConfiguration.ScalingStops>
    <xclb:PathConfiguration.ZIndexStops>
      <xclb:ZIndexStop Offset="0"
                       ZIndexFactor="0" />
      <xclb:ZIndexStop Offset="0.5"
                       ZIndexFactor="1" />
      <xclb:ZIndexStop Offset="1"
                       ZIndexFactor="0" />
    </xclb:PathConfiguration.ZIndexStops>
  </xclb:PathConfiguration>
</xclb:PathPanel.PathConfiguration>
```

The `StartOffset` property determines the offset on the path where the first item is initially displayed and where it falls when at the "top" of the list.

Finally, the `PathPadding` and `PathStretch` properties determine the padding between the path and the panel's bounds and how the path geometry is resized to fill its allocated space, respectively.
