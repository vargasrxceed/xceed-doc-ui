# The StackPanel and StackView Classes

The `StackPanel` and `StackView` classes provide a traditional layout of items in a listbox, yet provide a feel unlike what the stock listbox gives, thanks to the smooth scrolling of items and to its data virtualization, which keeps the application responsive at all times.

The following XAML illustrates how to set up a simple `StackPanel`, setting its Orientation to Vertical.

```xml
<xclb:ListBox Name="listBox1"
     ToolPaneVisibility="Collapsed">
  ...
  <xclb:ListBox.ItemsPanel>
    <xclb:ItemsPanelTemplate>
      <xclb:StackPanel Orientation="Vertical"/>
    </xclb:ItemsPanelTemplate>
  </xclb:ListBox.ItemsPanel>
  ...
</xclb:ListBox>
```

The `StackView` is used in the MultiViewPanel class to provide easy, animated switching between views. It is otherwise identical to StackPanel in terms of functionality.
