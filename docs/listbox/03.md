# Custom Data Sources

The `DataSourceProvider` class allows Xceed's listbox controls to support a wide range of data sources. The main purpose of this class is to translate requests from the component into queries to be processed by the data source. The data-source providers can be classified into two distinct categories: synchronous and asynchronous. A data-source provider is considered synchronous if all calls or requests made on it return synchronously.  All other cases are considered asynchronous.

Although a variety of data-source providers are built into Xceed's listbox controls (see Table 1) and attempts are made to automatically detect the appropriate one to use when binding the listbox to a data source, in some cases, it might be necessary to explicitly define which data-source provider to use or to create your own.

**Table 1:** Built-in data-source providers


| Provider	| Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| IndexBasedDataSourceProvider	| Wraps another **DataSourceProvider** in order to alter its behavior. The wrapped provider will receive requests that are easier to process for an indexed-based data source. |
| ListDataSourceProvider	| Wraps and data source that implements the IEnumerable interface. |
| WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider	| Wraps a WCF Data Services DataServiceQuery. This provider remains for backwards compatibility. If the data source is a `DataServiceQuery<>`, the `WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider<>` should be used instead. |
| `WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider<>`	| Wraps a WCF Data Services `DataServiceQuery<>` query. |

## Custom Data-Source Providers
In some cases, the built-in data-source providers will not be compatible with the targeted data source. In this situation, a custom data-source provider can be created by deriving from one of the following classes:

| Provider	| Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| AsyncDataSourceProvider	| One of the most primitive providers that can be used with an asynchronous data source. | 
| AsyncIndexDataSourceProvider	| Ideal for an asynchronous data source that can easily access items from an index or that cannot filter items efficiently. | 
| AsyncSqlDataSourceProvider	| Ideal for an asynchronous SQL data source. The generated queries can  easily be converted into SQL-like queries. If the query is used in whole or in part for dynamic SQL, it must first be validated to avoid SQL injection security breaches. |  
| SimpleAsyncIndexDataSourceProvider	| Simplified version of the AsyncIndexDataSourceProvider. | 
| SimpleSyncIndexDataSourceProvider	| Simplified version of the SyncIndexDataSourceProvider. | 
| SyncDataSourceProvider	| One of the most primitive providers that can be used with a synchronous data source. | 
| SyncIndexDataSourceProvider	| Ideal for a synchronous data source that can easily access items from an index or that cannot filter items efficiently. | 
| WcfDataServicesDataSourceProviderBase	| Ideal for a WCF Data Services data source if the built-in WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider does not provide all the desired functionality. If the data source is a `DataServiceQuery<>`, `WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider<>` should be used instead. | 
| `WcfDataServicesDataSourceProviderBase<>`	| Ideal for WCF Data Services data source if the built-in `WcfDataServicesDataSourceProvider<>` does not provide all the desired functionality. | 

All data-source providers must provide required information. For example,  the `ElementType` property must return the type of the elements contained in the data source.  Only columns that are bound to a property or a field found on this type can be grouped, sorted, or filtered.

In order to target an element precisely, each element must be unique. The `GetPrimaryKeyInfo` method must be overridden by your data-source provider and return the list of properties or fields that identify an element as being unique.

To change the filter operators and statistical functions that are supported by a data-source provider, the `GetSupportedFilterOperators` and `GetSupportedStatFunctions` methods must be overridden and return the modified list of filter operators and statistical functions.

Depending on the base class being used, it may be necessary to override some of the methods that deal with a precise type of query such as a count query, which requests the number of elements, the data query, which requests the elements themselves, the find query, which requests a position, the group-count query, which requests the number of groups per level, or the stat query, which requests the result of a statistical function. All queries are applied on a range.

Queries may be enabled or disabled via their associated `CanCount`, `CanFind`, `CanGroupCount`, and `CanCalculateStats` properties. It is not necessary of a data-source provider to support all queries.

## Processing Queries
In some cases, a method that handles a query in order to retrieve information from the data source will be called. Your role as an implementer is for query your data source according to the provided criteria.  Each criterion has a specific purpose: 

| Request	| Description |
|---------|-------------|
| FilterGroupRequest	| Keep only the elements of a target group. | 
| FilterRequest	| Keep only the elements that match the predicate. | 
| FindRequest	| Retrieve the position of an element. | 
| ItemJumpRequest	| Start retrieval from a target element. | 
| JumpRequest	| Start retrieval from a target position. | 
| SkipRequest	| Skip a number of elements. | 
| SortRequest	| Sort the elements. | 
| TakeRequest	| Take a number of elements.| 

Some of the criteria are mutually exclusive and may not be specified on every query.  If specified, here is the order in which the criteria must be applied in order to return the expected result:

1. FilterRequest, FilterGroupRequest, SortRequest
2. ItemJumpRequest, JumpRequest
3. SkipRequest
4. FindRequest, TakeRequest

Criteria may be enabled or disabled via their associated `CanFilterGroup`, `CanFilter`, `CanFind`, `CanJumpToItem`, `CanJump`, and `CanSkip` properties. It is not necessary for a data-source provider to support all criteria.
