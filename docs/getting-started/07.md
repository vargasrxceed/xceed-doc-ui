# LiveExplorer (Sample apps)

The LiveExplorer application, which is installed when the product is installed, contains sample apps and lets you examine the C# code behind and the XAML used to create the samples.

The source code and the application can be found in the sample-installation folder: C:\Xceed Samples\Xceed Toolkit Plus for WPF.

Starting at v4.3, the new Material Design LiveExplorer application, an upgrade of the standard LiveExplorer, will be showing the samples, xaml and code using the new MaterialDesign theme.
