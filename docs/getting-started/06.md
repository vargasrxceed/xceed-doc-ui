# Licensing

In order to use the controls provided by Xceed Toolkit Plus for WPF in your application, the `LicenseKey` property of the `Licenser` class must be set with a valid license key, before any other method of the component is called. If you use an invalid or expired license key, fail to license the control altogether, or license it in the wrong place in your code, an exception will be thrown at run time (see License Exception section below).

A valid license key can be a registered license key, which is delivered when you purchase Xceed Toolkit Plus for WPF, or a non-expired trial license key if you are evaluating the component.

## Setting the LicenseKey Property
The LicenseKey property must be set with a valid license key, before any other method of Xceed Toolkit Plus for WPF is called. Normally, this corresponds to the main entry point of the application, such as the App constructor.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="csharp" label="C#" default>

      ```csharp
        public App()
        {
          Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.Licenser.LicenseKey = "WTKXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX";
          InitializeComponent();
        }
      ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="vb.net" label="Visual Basic .NET">

      ```vb        
        Public Sub New()
          Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.Licenser.LicenseKey = "WTKXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX"
          InitializeComponent()
        End Sub
      ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## License Exception
If an invalid or expired license key is used or if the `LicenseKey` property is omitted or set in the wrong place, an exception will be thrown at run time; however, depending on the Visual Studio exception debugging settings and the browser in which the application is run, it may be displayed in different ways.

:::tip
If something goes wrong, the first thing to verify is whether the `LicenseKey` property has been set to a valid license key.
