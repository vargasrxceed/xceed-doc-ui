# Creating Your First AvalonDock Project

Begin by creating a new application from the installed templates. Once the new project is created, the control will be available in the toolbox and can be dragged onto the design surface.

If you prefer, you can add the references to the appropriates assemblies manually by right-clicking on the main project and selecting the *Add Reference*... menu item, which will open the *Add Reference* dialog box in which you can select the assemblies from the .NET tab. Now that the assemblies have been added, the required namespaces, which are included within the schema context, must be mapped using the xmlns attribute.

```xml
xmlns:xcad="http://schemas.xceed.com/wpf/xaml/avalondock"
```

Remember to use the namespace prefix (xctk:) in the body of your XAML!

The schema collection holds the following main namespaces:

| Namespace            | Description                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock   | Contains the core docking class (DockingManager) and event classes related to closing documents. |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Controls  | Contains the classes that represent the view controls used by AvalonDock, as well as interfaces and enumerations. |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Converters | Contains various converters. |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Layout | Contains the classes that represent the layout model used by AvalonDock, as well as interfaces and enumerations.  |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock. | Contains the classes needed to serialize an AvalonDock layout model. |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Properties | Contains a resource class, for looking up localized strings, etc. |
| Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock.Themes | Contains the base theme classes and the generic theme of AvalonDock. |

The schema collection for the themes holds the following namespaces:

| Namespace            | Description                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Xceed.Wpf.ListBox.Themes.Aero   | Contains the Aero theme for use with the docking control. |
| Xceed.Wpf.ListBox.Themes.Metro  | Contains the Metro for use with the docking control. |
| Xceed.Wpf.ListBox.Themes.VS2010 | Contains the Visual Studio 2010 theme for use with the docking control. |

Add a using statement for C# files or an Imports statement for VB.NET for the assemblies that you need:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="csharp" label="C#" default>

      ```csharp
        using Xceed.Wpf.AvalonDock;
      ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="vb.net" label="Visual Basic .NET">

      ```vb        
        Imports Xceed.WPF.AvalonDock
      ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Licensing
The last step is to license the control by setting the property. Refer to the [Licensing](06) topic for detailed information on how to license the component for distribution.
